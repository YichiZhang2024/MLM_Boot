In this chapter, we introduced different multilevel bootstrap procedures and described how and when to use them. Specifically, we reviewed parametric, wild, residual, and cases bootstrap. We discussed five ways of constructing confidence intervals (CIs) after obtaining a bootstrap sampling distribution: bootstrap normal CI, basic CI, studentized CI, percentile CI, and bias-corrected and accelerated CI. In an empirical example, we illustrated how to obtain these bootstrap CIs in R packages for the fixed effects, intraclass correlation, and $R^2$. Lastly, we summarized statistical software programs that support bootstrap procedures for multilevel data.
