In this chapter, we introduced different types of bootstrapping procedure and described how and when to use bootstrapping methods to obtain bias-corrected estimates, accurate confidence intervals and statistical inferences with violated assumptions. We illustrated the process to obtain bootstrapped CIs for the fixed effects, ICC and $R^2$ in an empirical example. Lastly, we summarized statistical software that support multilevel bootstrapping.
