In this chapter, we introduced different types of bootstrapping procedures and described how and when to use these bootstrapping methods. Specifically, we reviewed parametric bootstrap, wild bootstrap, residual bootstrap and cases bootstrap. We discussed five ways to construct CIs after obtaining a bootstrap sampling distribution: bootstrap normal CI, basic CI, studentized CI, percentile CI, and bias-corrected and accelerated CI. We illustrated the process to obtain these bootstrap CIs for the fixed effects, ICC and 𝑅 2 in an empirical example. Lastly, we summarized statistical software that supports bootstrapping procedures for multilevel data.
