In this chapter, we introduced different multilevel bootstrap procedures and described how and when to use them. Specifically, we reviewed parametric, residual, wild, and cases bootstraps. We discussed five ways of constructing confidence intervals (CIs) after obtaining a bootstrap sampling distribution: bootstrap normal CI, basic CI, studentized CI, percentile CI, and bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) CI. In an empirical example, we illustrated how to obtain these bootstrap CIs with R packages for the fixed effects, random effects, intraclass correlation, and $R^2$. Lastly, we detailed statistical software programs that support bootstrap procedures for multilevel data. In general, our suggestion is to use the residual bootstrap with studentized CI or BCa CI for (transformed) parameters if sample size is more than 70 clusters or has more than 25 observations for the average cluster size, see @lai2021 for a detailed discussion.  For smaller sample sizes, we recommend using the residual bootstrap with the basic CI. However, each type of bootstrapping procedure has different assumptions, so researchers should first check if distributional assumptions are tenable and then select the appropriate procedure. In terms of bootstrap CIs, we recommend that researchers compare different CIs and report BCa or studentized CIs if they are obtainable.
