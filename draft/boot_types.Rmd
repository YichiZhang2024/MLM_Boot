## 1. Parametric multilevel bootstrap 

The parametric bootstrap has the strongest assumption among all methods, as it assumes a correct function form and residual distributions. Residuals, are assumed to 

1. 

## 2. Residuals multilevel bootstrap 

Different from parametric bootstrap, residuals bootstrap does not assume the residuals follow certain distributions. However, the homoscedasticity of residuals still hold. 

### 2.1 Residual bootstrap

### 2.2 Wild bootstrap
  
## 3. Cases multilevel bootstrap 

The cases bootstrap has the least assumption because it only assumes a correct specification of hiearchical structure.
