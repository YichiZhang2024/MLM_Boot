Results showed that, overall, the residual bootstrap with studentized CI had the best coverage rates (94.75\% on average), whereas the residual bootstrap with basic CI had better coverage in small samples. These two procedures for constructing CIs showed better coverage than using analytic methods for both normal and nonnormal data. In addition, I provide an illustrative example showing how bootstrap CIs for multilevel eﬀect size can be easily obtained using the statistical software R and the R package bootm m.

The Level-1 variance estimate is quite accurate, but for the smallest total sample size. The skewed distribution (skewed to the right) for the variance estimates was confirmed. Owing to this, the bias of parameter estimates is negative. The bias is quite large in the small sample situation. In some cases the results deviate severely from what one would expect. As a result of the unequal proportion of the bias of the parameter estimate and the bias of the estimate for the corresponding standard error, certain tests based upon these estimates will be conservative. The minimum sample size indicated in the literature will not suffice. Depending on the level, the number of observations should be at least 25.

The method is extended to cover nonlinear parameters, regression M-estimators, nonlinear regression and generalized linear models. Interval estimators can be constructed from the jackknife histogram. Three bootstrap methods are considered. Two are shown to give biased variance estimators and one does not have the bias-robustness property enjoyed by the weighted delete-one jackknife. A general method for resampling residuals is proposed. It gives variance estimators that are bias-robust. Several bias-reducing estimators are proposed. Some simulation results are reported.},

Results showed that, overall, the residual bootstrap with studentized CI had the best coverage rates (94.75\% on average), whereas the residual bootstrap with basic CI had better coverage in small samples. These two procedures for constructing CIs showed better coverage than using analytic methods for both normal and nonnormal data. In addition, I provide an illustrative example showing how bootstrap CIs for multilevel eﬀect size can be easily obtained using the statistical software R and the R package bootm m. I strongly encourage applied researchers to report CIs to adequately convey the uncertainty of their eﬀect size estimates.},

	abstract = {The bootstrap was devised for situations where the usual estimators may be biased, or where exact inference is required, for example, because distributional assumptions are not satisfied or only large sample properties hold. Consider a simple random sample of n observations x1...xn, from which we wish to estimate a population quantity, say a mean or median. We choose an estimator, say x , and we wish to estimate features of the distribution of this estimator, say its standard error or population quantiles. The simplest nonparametric bootstrap is obtained as described below. We sample randomly (i.e., according to the assumed mechanism that generated the observations), with replacement, n observations from the original sample. Denote this by X' =\{x1,....,xn\}. Then we can obtain B of these bootstrap samples, X1,X2,....,XB. For each of these we calculate our estimate, say of the mean, and each of these is referred to as a bootstrap replicate. It is such replicates that are used for inference. In this chapter we shall first review some standard uses for the bootstrap and then discuss extensions to multilevel data.

	abstract = {This book gives a broad and up-to-date coverage of bootstrap methods, with numerous applied examples, developed in a coherent way with the necessary theoretical basis. Applications include stratified data; finite populations; censored and missing data; linear, nonlinear, and smooth regression models; classification; time series and spatial problems. Special features of the book include: extensive discussion of significance tests and confidence intervals; material on various diagnostic methods; and methods for efficient computation, including improved Monte Carlo simulation. Each chapter includes both practical and theoretical exercises. Included with the book is a disk of purpose-written S-Plus programs for implementing the methods described in the text. Computer algorithms are clearly described, and computer code is included on a 3-inch, 1.4M disk for use with IBM computers and compatible machines. Users must have the S-Plus computer application.
