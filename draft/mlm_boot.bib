	abstract = {Although many methodologists and professional organizations have urged applied researchers to compute and report eﬀect size measures accompanying tests of statistical signiﬁcance, discussions on obtaining conﬁdence interval (CI) for eﬀect size with clustered/multilevel data have been scarce. In this paper, I explore the bootstrap as a viable and accessible alternative for obtaining CIs for multilevel standardized mean diﬀerence eﬀect size for cluster-randomized trials. A simulation was carried out to compare 17 analytic and bootstrap procedures for constructing CIs for multilevel eﬀect size, in terms of empirical coverage rates and width, for both normal and nonnormal data. Results showed that, overall, the residual bootstrap with studentized CI had the best coverage rates (94.75\% on average), whereas the residual bootstrap with basic CI had better coverage in small samples. These two procedures for constructing CIs showed better coverage than using analytic methods for both normal and nonnormal data. In addition, I provide an illustrative example showing how bootstrap CIs for multilevel eﬀect size can be easily obtained using the statistical software R and the R package bootm m. I strongly encourage applied researchers to report CIs to adequately convey the uncertainty of their eﬀect size estimates.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the performance of the most popular bootstrap schemes for multilevel data. Also, we propose a modified version of the wild bootstrap procedure for hierarchical data structures. The wild bootstrap does not require homoscedasticity or assumptions on the distribution of the error processes. Hence, it is a valuable tool for robust inference in a multilevel framework. We assess the finite size performances of the schemes through a Monte Carlo study. The results show that for big sample sizes it always pays off to adopt an agnostic approach as the wild bootstrap outperforms other techniques.},

	abstract = {This book gives a broad and up-to-date coverage of bootstrap methods, with numerous applied examples, developed in a coherent way with the necessary theoretical basis. Applications include stratified data; finite populations; censored and missing data; linear, nonlinear, and smooth regression models; classification; time series and spatial problems. Special features of the book include: extensive discussion of significance tests and confidence intervals; material on various diagnostic methods; and methods for efficient computation, including improved Monte Carlo simulation. Each chapter includes both practical and theoretical exercises. Included with the book is a disk of purpose-written S-Plus programs for implementing the methods described in the text. Computer algorithms are clearly described, and computer code is included on a 3-inch, 1.4M disk for use with IBM computers and compatible machines. Users must have the S-Plus computer application.

	abstract = {In this paper Monte Carlo methods were used to study the distribution characteristics of variance estimates in two-level models. Little is known, in general, of the small sample properties of these estimates. Monte Carlo simulation has been used to determine the extent of agreement with the large sample theory in small sample situations. Confirmations of theoretical results were found in most areas. The Level-1 variance estimate is quite accurate, but for the smallest total sample size. The skewed distribution (skewed to the right) for the variance estimates was confirmed. Owing to this, the bias of parameter estimates is negative. The bias is quite large in the small sample situation. In some cases the results deviate severely from what one would expect. As a result of the unequal proportion of the bias of the parameter estimate and the bias of the estimate for the corresponding standard error, certain tests based upon these estimates will be conservative. The minimum sample size indicated in the literature will not suffice. Depending on the level, the number of observations should be at least 25. Sample sizes on which the calculation of the estimates depends, are especially important.},
