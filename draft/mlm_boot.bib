	abstract = {In this paper, we study the performance of the most popular bootstrap schemes for multilevel data. Also, we propose a modified version of the wild bootstrap procedure for hierarchical data structures. The wild bootstrap does not require homoscedasticity or assumptions on the distribution of the error processes. Hence, it is a valuable tool for robust inference in a multilevel framework. We assess the finite size performances of the schemes through a Monte Carlo study. The results show that for big sample sizes it always pays off to adopt an agnostic approach as the wild bootstrap outperforms other techniques.},

The method is extended to cover nonlinear parameters, regression M-estimators, nonlinear regression and generalized linear models. Interval estimators can be constructed from the jackknife histogram. Three bootstrap methods are considered. Two are shown to give biased variance estimators and one does not have the bias-robustness property enjoyed by the weighted delete-one jackknife. A general method for resampling residuals is proposed. It gives variance estimators that are bias-robust. Several bias-reducing estimators are proposed. Some simulation results are reported.},

	abstract = {In this paper Monte Carlo methods were used to study the distribution characteristics of variance estimates in two-level models. Little is known, in general, of the small sample properties of these estimates. Monte Carlo simulation has been used to determine the extent of agreement with the large sample theory in small sample situations. Confirmations of theoretical results were found in most areas. The Level-1 variance estimate is quite accurate, but for the smallest total sample size. The skewed distribution (skewed to the right) for the variance estimates was confirmed. Owing to this, the bias of parameter estimates is negative. The bias is quite large in the small sample situation. In some cases the results deviate severely from what one would expect. As a result of the unequal proportion of the bias of the parameter estimate and the bias of the estimate for the corresponding standard error, certain tests based upon these estimates will be conservative. The minimum sample size indicated in the literature will not suffice. Depending on the level, the number of observations should be at least 25. Sample sizes on which the calculation of the estimates depends, are especially important.},

A simulation was carried out to compare 17 analytic and bootstrap procedures for constructing CIs for multilevel eﬀect size, in terms of empirical coverage rates and width, for both normal and nonnormal data. Results showed that, overall, the residual bootstrap with studentized CI had the best coverage rates (94.75\% on average), whereas the residual bootstrap with basic CI had better coverage in small samples. These two procedures for constructing CIs showed better coverage than using analytic methods for both normal and nonnormal data. In addition, I provide an illustrative example showing how bootstrap CIs for multilevel eﬀect size can be easily obtained using the statistical software R and the R package bootm m. I strongly encourage applied researchers to report CIs to adequately convey the uncertainty of their eﬀect size estimates.},

Consider a simple random sample of n observations x1...xn, from which we wish to estimate a population quantity, say a mean or median. We choose an estimator, say x , and we wish to estimate features of the distribution of this estimator, say its standard error or population quantiles. The simplest nonparametric bootstrap is obtained as described below. We sample randomly (i.e., according to the assumed mechanism that generated the observations), with replacement, n observations from the original sample. Denote this by X' =\{x1,....,xn\}. Then we can obtain B of these bootstrap samples, X1,X2,....,XB. For each of these we calculate our estimate, say of the mean, and each of these is referred to as a bootstrap replicate. It is such replicates that are used for inference. In this chapter we shall first review some standard uses for the bootstrap and then discuss extensions to multilevel data.

  abstract = {Background:Many investigators rely on previously published point estimates of the intraclass correlation coefficient rather than on their associated confidence intervals to determine the required size of a newly planned cluster randomized trial. Although confidence interval methods for the intraclass correlation coefficient that can be applied to community-based trials have been developed for a continuous outcome variable, fewer methods exist for a binary outcome variable. The aim of this study is to evaluate confidence interval methods for the intraclass correlation coefficient applied to binary outcomes in community intervention trials enrolling a small number of large clusters. Existing methods for confidence interval construction are examined and compared to a new ad hoc approach based on dividing clusters into a large number of smaller sub-clusters and subsequently applying existing methods to the resulting data.Methods:Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess the width and coverage of confidence intervals for the intraclass correlation coefficient based on Smith?s large sample approximation of the standard error of the one-way analysis of variance estimator, an inverted modified Wald test for the Fleiss?Cuzick estimator, and intervals constructed using a bootstrap-t applied to a variance-stabilizing transformation of the intraclass correlation coefficient estimate. In addition, a new approach is applied in which clusters are randomly divided into a large number of smaller sub-clusters with the same methods applied to these data (with the exception of the bootstrap-t interval, which assumes large cluster sizes). These methods are also applied to a cluster randomized trial on adolescent tobacco use for illustration.Results:When applied to a binary outcome variable in a small number of large clusters, existing confidence interval methods for the intraclass correlation coefficient provide poor coverage. However, confidence intervals constructed using the new approach combined with Smith?s method provide nominal or close to nominal coverage when the intraclass correlation coefficient is small ({$<$}0.05), as is the case in most community intervention trials.Conclusion:This study concludes that when a binary outcome variable is measured in a small number of large clusters, confidence intervals for the intraclass correlation coefficient may be constructed by dividing existing clusters into sub-clusters (e.g. groups of 5) and using Smith?s method. The resulting confidence intervals provide nominal or close to nominal coverage across a wide range of parameters when the intraclass correlation coefficient is small ({$<$}0.05). Application of this method should provide investigators with a better understanding of the uncertainty associated with a point estimator of the intraclass correlation coefficient used for determining the sample size needed for a newly designed community-based trial.},

In particular, several distinct bootstrap methods are considered, with emphasis on the mathematical correctness of these procedures. The percentile, bias-corrected percentile and accelerated bias-corrected percentile methods, developed by Efron, are reviewed in both parametric and nonparametric situations. A procedure related to the accelerated bias-corrected method, which avoids explicit calculation of the analytical corrections required in Efron's method, is also introduced. In the context of a functional approach for the construction of confidence regions, the bootstrap is motivated as a method to estimate the distributions of approximate pivots. Finally, iterative bootstrap methods are discussed as means to improve coverage accuracy.},

  abstract = {This text will equip both practitioners and theorists with the necessary background in testing hypothesis and decision theory to enable innumerable practical applications of statistics. Its intuitive and informal style makes it suitable as a text for both students and researchers. It can serve as the basis a one- or two-semester graduate course as well as a standard handbook of statistical procedures for the practitioners\{u2019\} desk. Parametric, permutation, and bootstrap procedures for testing hypotheses are developed side by side. The emphasis on distribution-free permutation procedures will enable workers in applied fields to use the most powerful statistic for their applications and satisfy regulatory agency demands for methods that yield exact significance levels, not approximations. Algebra and an understanding of discrete probability will take the reader through all but the appendix, which utilizes probability measures in its proofs. The revised and expanded text of the 3rd edition includes many more real-world illustrations from biology, business, clinical trials, economics, geology, law, medicine, social science and engineering along with twice the number of exercises. Real-world problems of missing and censored data, multiple comparisons, nonresponders, after-the-fact covariates, and outliers are dealt with at length. New sections are added on sequential analysis and multivariate analysis plus a chapter on the exact analysis of multi-factor designs based on the recently developed theory of synchronous permutations. The book's main features include: Detailed consideration of one-, two-, and k-sample tests, contingency tables, clinical trials, cluster analysis, multiple comparisons, multivariate analysis, and repeated measures Numerous practical applications in archeology, biology, business, climatology, clinical trials, economics, education, engineering, geology, law, medicine, and the social sciences Valuable techniques for reducing computation time Practical advice on experimental design Sections on sequential analysis Comparisons among competing bootstrap, parametric, and permutation techniques. From a review of the first edition: "Permutation Tests is a welcome addition to the literature on this subject and will prove a valuable guide for practitioners ... This book has already become an important addition to my reference library. Those interested in permutation tests and its applications will enjoy reading it." (Journal of the American Statistical Association) From a review of the second edition: "Permutation Tests is superb as a resource for practitioners. The text covers a broad range of topics, and has myriad pointers to topics not directly addressed. . . the book gives guidance and inspiration to encourage developing one\{u2019\}s own perfectly tailored statistics\{u2026\}The writing is fun to read."

Nonpivotal methods are still the overwhelmingly popular choice when statisticians use the bootstrap to compute confidence intervals, but they are not necessarily the most appropriate. In this paper we point out some of the theoretical advantages of pivoting. They include a reduction in the error of the bootstrap distribution function estimate, from n-1/2 to n-1h-1/2 (where h denotes bandwidth); and a reduction in coverage error of confidence intervals, from either n-1/2h-1/2 or n-1/2h1/2 (depending on which nonpivotal method is used) to n-1. Several comparisons are drawn with the case of nonparametric density estimation, where a pivotal approach also reduces errors associated with confidence intervals, but where the orders of magnitude of the respective errors are quite different from their counterparts for nonparametric regression.},

	abstract = {In this paper Monte Carlo methods were used to study the distribution characteristics of variance estimates in two-level models. Little is known, in general, of the small sample properties of these estimates. Monte Carlo simulation has been used to determine the extent of agreement with the large sample theory in small sample situations. Confirmations of theoretical results were found in most areas. The Level-1 variance estimate is quite accurate, but for the smallest total sample size. The skewed distribution (skewed to the right) for the variance estimates was confirmed. Owing to this, the bias of parameter estimates is negative. The bias is quite large in the small sample situation. In some cases the results deviate severely from what one would expect. As a result of the unequal proportion of the bias of the parameter estimate and the bias of the estimate for the corresponding standard error, certain tests based upon these estimates will be conservative. The minimum sample size indicated in the literature will not suffice. Depending on the level, the number of observations should be at least 25. Sample sizes on which the calculation of the estimates depends, are especially important.},

The usual Student's t test of H0: ρ=0 is valid when X and Y are independent, so in particular the conditional variance of Y, given X, does not vary with X. But when the conditional variance does vary with X, Student's t uses an incorrect estimate of the standard error. In effect, when rejecting H0, this might be due to ρ≠0, but perhaps the main reason for rejecting is that there is heteroscedasticity. This note compares two heteroscedastic methods for testing H0 and finds that in terms of Type I errors, the nested bootstrap performed best in simulations when using ρ. When using one of two robust analogues of ρ (Spearman's rho and the percentage bend correlation), little or no advantage was found, in terms of Type I error probabilities, when using a nested bootstrap versus the basic percentile method. As for power, generally an adjusted percentile bootstrap, used in conjunction with r, performed better than the nested bootstrap, even in situations where, for the null case, the estimated probability of a Type I error was lower when using the adjusted percentile method. As for computing a confidence interval when correlations are positive, situations are found where all methods perform in an unsatisfactory manner.},

Even though several tests are available in the literature, none of them perform well in terms of Type I error probability under various sample size and parameter combinations. In fact, Type I errors can be highly inflated for some of the commonly used tests; a serious issue that appears to have been overlooked. We propose a parametric bootstrap (PB) approach and compare it with three existing location-scale invariant tests—the Welch test, the James test and the generalized F (GF) test. The Type I error rates and powers of the tests are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation. Our studies show that the PB test is the best among the four tests with respect to Type I error rates. The PB test performs very satisfactorily even for small samples while the Welch test and the GF test exhibit poor Type I error properties when the sample sizes are small and/or the number of means to be compared is moderate to large. The James test performs better than the Welch test and the GF test. It is also noted that the same tests can be used to test the significance of the random effect variance component in a one-way random model under unequal error variances. Such models are widely used to analyze data from inter-laboratory studies. The methods are illustrated using some examples.},

	abstract = {There is on-going concern about the relationship between class size and achievement for children in their first years of schooling. The Institute of Education's class size project was set up to address this issue and began recruiting in the autumn of 1996. However, because of the non-normality of achievement measures, especially in mathematics, the results have hitherto been presented by using transformed achievement measures. This makes the interpretation difficult for non-statisticians. Ideally, the data would be modelled on the original scale and a bootstrap procedure used to ensure that inferences are robust to non-normality. However, the data are multilevel. In the paper we therefore propose a nonparametric residual bootstrap procedure that is suitable for multilevel models, show that it is consistent and present a simulation study which demonstrates its potential to yield substantial reductions in the difference between nominal and actual confidence interval coverage, compared with a parametric bootstrap, when the underlying distribution of the data is non-normal. We then apply our approach to estimate the relationship between class size and achievement for children in their reception year, after adjusting for other possible determinants.},

This means that the outcome of the test will depend on the sequence of random numbers used to generate the bootstrap samples, and it necessarily results in some loss of power. We examine the extent of this power loss and propose a simple pretest procedure for choosing the number of bootstrap samples so as to minimize experimental randomness. Simulation experiments suggest that this procedure will work very well in practice.},

	shorttitle = {Fundamentals of {Modern} {Statistical} {Methods}},
	abstract = {Conventional statistical methods have a very serious flaw. They routinely miss differences among groups or associations among variables that are detected by more modern techniques - even under very small departures from normality. Hundreds of journal articles have described the reasons standard techniques can be unsatisfactory, but simple, intuitive explanations are generally unavailable. Improved methods have been derived, but they are far from obvious or intuitive based on the training most researchers receive. Situations arise where even highly nonsignificant results become significant when analyzed with more modern methods. Without assuming any prior training in statistics, Part I of this book describes basic statistical principles from a point of view that makes their shortcomings intuitive and easy to understand. The emphasis is on verbal and graphical descriptions of concepts. Part II describes modern methods that address the problems covered in Part I. Using data from actual studies, many examples are included to illustrate the practical problems with conventional procedures and how more modern methods can make a substantial difference in the conclusions reached in many areas of statistical research.

	abstract = {Homogeneity of variance (HOV) is a well-known but often untested assumption in the context of multilevel models (MLMs). However, depending on how large the violation is, how different group sizes are, and the variance pairing, standard errors can be over or underestimated even when using MLMs, resulting in questionable inferential tests. We evaluate several tests (e.g., the H statistic, Breusch Pagan, Levene’s test) that can be used with MLMs to assess violations of HOV. Although the traditional robust standard errors used with MLMs require at least 50 clusters to be effective, we assess a robust standard error adjustment (i.e., the CR2 estimator) that can be used even with a few clusters. Findings are assessed using a Monte Carlo simulation and are further illustrated using an applied example. We show that explicitly modeling the heterogenous variance structures or using the CR2 estimator are both effective at ameliorating the issues associated with the fixed effects of the regression model related to violations of HOV resulting from between-group differences.},
