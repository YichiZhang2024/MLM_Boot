Multilevel data is common in social and behavioral science research. For example, students are nested within classrooms; the same individual may be assessed at different time points in longitudinal studies. To account for clustered data, multilevel models (MLM), also called hierarchical linear models (HLM), have been widely used. 
<!-- ML: Not clear whether you meant ML to be an estimation method, or a class of estimation methods that include REML as well -->
The primary estimation method in MLM is the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, which generates the most probable value of model parameters given the observed data [@raudenbush2002]. 
<!-- ML: Does the literature use FIML? It seems more common in the missing data literature -->
The common versions of ML are restricted maximum likelihood (REML) and full information maximum likelihood (FIML). The accuracy of the ML estimates and the associated statistical inferences depend on whether the underlying assumptions are satisfied. Specifically, ML assumes a sufficiently large sample size, and that residuals at each level follow independent and identical distributions (i.i.d.) [@leeden2008]. When these two assumptions are violated, the desirable properties of ML, namely consistency, asymptotic efficiency, and asymptotic normality, might not, resulting in biased standard error estimates with inaccurate inferences. The bootstrap, a resampling method that approximates the sampling distribution of statistics, can be used to obtain more accurate standard error estimates under this situation [@busing1993]. <!-- ML: how about inferences and confidence intervals? -->

This chapter explains different types of bootstrapping procedures for MLM, including the recently developed wild bootstrap that is robust to heteroscedasticity. This chapter aims to illustrate how and when to use these bootstrap methods in applied research.

<!-- ML: See if I change the meaning for the first sentence -->
In this chapter, we start with an overview of assumption violations in MLM, followed by the general idea of bootstrap methods for regression models. Next, we discuss the challenges of bootstrapping in MLM, and introduce several bootstrapping procedures. We then transition to bootstrap confidence intervals and comparisons of some commonly available options. <!-- ML: say a few words on what the example/data is about -->The last section provides an illustrative example of the various bootstrap methods and comparisons of results. The chapter ends with suggestions on available software and resources for MLM bootstrap methods. <!-- I think you already said last section . . . and then the ending is another section?? -->
